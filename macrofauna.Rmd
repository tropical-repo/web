# Methods

We collected sediment from each site (\~20 meters) with a 6" x 6" petite Grab sampler weekly. The sampler was attached lowered to the seafloor from a boat and collected 2 L of sediment from the surface of the seafloor. The material was immediately put into sterile bags after collection and stored on ice in the boat. Upon arrival at the lab, three technical replicate samples (1 mL) will be taken from each sample site for microbial analyses. Fresh sea water running through a 1 μm polyester felt filter bag was used to sieve the remaining sample material into three size classes. The sediment and detritus retained by the screens (125, 250 μm and 500 μm) was immediately stored in 4 % buffered formalin for 48 hours and then transferred to 70 % EtOH and stained with 2g/L Bengal Rose for long-term preservation. This prevents any calcium carbonate corrosion due to formalin and turns all specimens that were alive at the time of sampling a bright red color. Sample material was sorted and all living organisms (stained red) were removed under a dissecting microscope from the sediment. These organisms were then counted and identified to the lowest level possible.

# Macrofauna Abundance

Visualize the top 12 most abundant species

First we look at the total number of animals found. Then we calculate the abundance in each sample, through time at each site. The size classes are combined to see total abundances.

```{r living orgs, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(ds[,12:18],horizontal = TRUE,las=2, main="Total Live Organisims (higher level groups)") # select higher level taxonomic groups
boxplot(ds[,16:32],horizontal = TRUE,las=2, main="Total Live Organisims (lower level)") 
# select lower level taxonomic groups

```

Here the function `mvabund`calculates the abundance in each sample based on counts of all of the lowest taxonomic groups identified. It is a part of mvabund package. Data is transformed (square-root) (`sqrt`) to better visualize the differences and is actually a very transformation for abundance data. Site is defined as a factor, `plot.mvabund` is a used to visualize top 12 most abundant species in the full dataset. At the end of this code block, a raw time-series object with all sites and a smoothed time-series object with all sites are generated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#ds_ab <- mvabund(ds[,16:32]) # calculate abundance per sample

#plot.mvabund(ds_ab, n.vars = 10, type="bx", transformation="sqrt",
#             fg="lightblue", main="top 10 species abundances")
#plot.mvabund(ds_ab, factor(ds$site))
```

# Creatures of Interest

Where do these creatures live? What do they eat and how do they eat it? What eats them? How do they protect themselves? How do they breath?

## 1. Polychaetes

a.  *Errantiata* or *Aciculata* - worms that move

Errantiata are a subclass of polychaetes (segmented marine worms). They are free-living and can be found throughout the world in marine and brackish environments. They usually have well developed jaws and sensory organs.

b.  *Sedentaria* - worms that don't move

Sedentaria are non-mobile polychaetes (subclass). They often have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding.

## 2. Echinodermata

a.  *Ophiuroidea* (class)

Closely related to the starfish, these brittle and basket stars crawl across the sea floor using their flexible arms. They are a large group and are found throughout the world's oceans, common in shallow marine habitats. they are dominant in the deep sea and in deep water but are also one of the most abundant invertebrates on coral reefs. Most are scavengers and detritus feeders, but they also hunt small crustaceans and worms.

Gas exchange occurs through cilia-lined sacs called bursae that open and take in water in, and ventilate by pumping their disc. They are important in the diets of many crustaceans and fish, and some species are known to burrow into the sediment.

b.  *Echinoidea* (class)

These are benthic marine species, such as sea urchins, sand dollars, and are primarily grazers or scavengers. Many are considered to be important herbivores. 

Most sea urchins possess five pairs of external gills attached to the peristomial membrane around their mouths. These thin-walled projections of the body cavity are the main organs of respiration in those urchins that possess them. Fluid can be pumped through the gills' interiors by muscles associated with the lantern, but this does not provide a continuous flow, and occurs only when the animal is low in oxygen. Tube feet can also act as respiratory organs, and are the primary sites of gas exchange in heart urchins and sand dollars, both of which lack gills. The inside of each tube foot is divided by a septum which reduces diffusion between the incoming and outgoing streams of fluid.


## 3. Mollusca

a.  *Caudofoveata* (class)

![](http://molluscs.at/images/weichtiere/aplacophora/ch_intermedium.jpg)

Chaetoderma intermedium, a caudofoveatan. Picture: Nina Mikkelsen, Bergen University.

Caudofoveatans are worm-like molluscs that generally are very small, mostly only few centimetres long, and are the least known of all the molluscs. It is somewhat unusual that we found so many of these in our Almirante Bay samples because this mollusc class is typically found in deep-water (6000 m or more)! They are carivourous and feed on detritus and bottom-dwelling microorganisms. They have a strange scale matrix that makes up their 'shell' (atypical for molluscs).

[more info here](http://molluscs.at/caudofoveata/)

b.  *Bivalvia* (class)

c.  *Gastropoda* (class)

d.  *Scaphopoda* (class)

Also known as tusk shells, these distinctive molluscs breath with their feet. Actually they use their foot to pump water through their body and this allows there tissues to oxygenate (like a heart would function in most animals). They have conical shells that are open at both ends and live their adult lived buried in the sediment with their head pointed downward (imagine living your entire life with your head stuck in the mud?!). The opening on the narrow posterior end of their shell sticks out of the mud and takes in seawater for oxygen and expells waste.

These animals have lost their have gills and rely on their mantle tissues to not only produce their shell, but also to function like a gill. Their mantle is fused into a tube that surrounds the body and water is circulated around the cavity by cilia, When oxygen gets low they eject the water through the top end of the shell by contracting their foot (i.e breath with their feet)!

These also are carnivourous, searching for food in the sediment. This can be forams, detritus and other molluscs. They have tiny sense organs (statocysts) to detect their food and they use threadlike cilia-bearing tentacles (captacula) to probe for food.

## 4. Crustacea

a.  *Amphipoda* (order)

Small, mostly marine crustaceans typically less than 10 mm long. They are one of the most specious and morphologically diverse groups. They are poor swimmers, highly modified to crawl on the bottom of the benthos. The have gills on their thoracic segments (pleopods), and an open circulatory system with a heart, haemocyanin and haemolymph. These are brooding species, and females have a marsupium in which they hold developing eggs. There are no larval stages, hatching as a juvenile form. Dissolved oxygen is known to be directly correlated to their size. Long-term hypoxia threatens population persistence.

They are highly abundant in the marine environment, and as such are important to the food chain, as herbivores, detritivores, micropredators and scavengers (Lowry and Springhorpe 2001).

Fun fact: When you squish them they emit a stron stink like old gym socks.

b.  *Cladocera* (sub-order) - water fleas, benthic predator

Small crustaceans between 0.2 -6.0 mm long with a compound eye. Most live in fresh water. Only eight species have adapted to marine environments, these are all in the Podonidae family (Branchiopoda). Marine species are rare. They have fascinating reproductive cycles that support their persistence in some of the harshest environments on Earth. When environmental conditions are good, females asexually clone themselves over and over again. When conditions deteriorate, the females produce males which then sexually reproduce. The eggs they produce are called resting or dormant eggs and they can remain viable in the environment for long periods of time, only hatching when conditions are sufficiant to sustain life (or when they reach a habitat with happy conditions). This cyclical parthenogenesis mode of life evolved in the Permian period.

They do have gills, they are mostly benthic, and they have huge eyes. Instead of being filter feeders like their freshwater relatives, they are active predators.

c.  *Copepoda* (sub- class)

Most benthic copepods are Harpacticoids, a large highly diverse order of copepoda. They are known to be highly adaptable (unlike amphipods which are often highly sensitive). They are also the second largest meiofaunal group in marine sediment after nemotodes.

Some are known to also control dinoflagellate populations, eating the most unpalatable and toxic species. They are important for nutrient recycling and appear to have an important impact on denitrification and sediment nitrogen fluxes (Stock 2014).

d.  *Decapoda* (order)

e.  *Cumacea* (order) - hooded shrimp

They live on soft bottoms, mostly marine. Species diversity increases with depth. They mainly feed on microorganisms and organic material from the sediment. Some can pierce organs of small crustaceans . They are important for fish food. , found throughout the world.

f.  *Ostracoda* (class)

My personal favorite crustacean. Typically the size of a tomatoe seed, brood, scavange and activly predate in the night. Hide during the day in marine sediment. Sexually reproduce, important food for fish, and capable of producing an array of blue light displays.

## 5. *Vertebrata* 

Fish and things with backbones.

## 6. *Sipuncula * - peanut worms

These unsegmented marine, benthic worms transport fluid and gas exchange in their coelom, which contains the respiratory pigment haemerythrin. They also have tentacles surrounding their mouth that are thought to function as gills.
